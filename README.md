## Common Errors and Fixes

### Visual Studio
Some errors that you may come across while working on Visual Studio: 

#### The type or namespace "UnityEngine" could not be found - Can not edit scripts

You can regenerate the Visual Studio project files by deleting the `.csproj` and `.sln` files from your Unity project folder. Open any script in your project through the Unity Editor and Unity will recreate the files. 

You can also use `Assets - Open C# Project` through Unity's menu bar.

If your issue is not fixed, look in the folder `Library\UnityAssemblies` in your project directory. The Unity libraries including UnityEngine.dll should be there. If not then you can copy them from another project's folder. You can also try to delete the whole Library folder when the project is not open and let Unity regenerate it.
